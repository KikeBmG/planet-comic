_Quique GÃ³mez. Diciembre 2017._

_Proyecto Final del C.F.G.S. Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web_

## Quickstart

To get started:

```bash
npm init @open-wc
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
- `format` fixes linting and formatting errors

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
